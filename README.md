# ModelRocketAvionicsPCB
Avionics PCB for Model Rocketry

Howdy! This is a repo for an avionics board designed for small scale model rockets. The goal of the project is to provide an easy to integrate system that provides telemetry data measurements. 

The main features are:
- 3 DOF Accelerometer (upto 24g)
- 3 DOF Gyroscope
- Barometric Pressure/Altitude sensor
- microSD Card data storage
- USB for charging, reprogramming and microSD card reading*
- Expansion header for future functionality (Radio communication, rocket ignition, etc)

*usb programming and microSD card reading may not be implemented initially
