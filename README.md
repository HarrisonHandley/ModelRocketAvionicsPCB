'Cheap', Easy Avionics for Model Rockets!

Howdy! This is a repo for an avionics board designed for small scale model rockets. The goal of the project is to provide an easy to integrate system that provides telemetry data measurements. 

The main features are:
- 3 DOF Accelerometer (upto 24g)
- 3 DOF Gyroscope
- Barometric Pressure/Altitude sensor
- microSD Card data storage
- USB for charging, reprogramming and microSD card reading*
- Expansion header for future functionality called "Stages" (see below)

*Usb programming and microSD card reading probably won't be implemented initially.

Potential/Planned Stages/Expansion Boards:
- Radio link/communications (Provides real-time telemetry data over a short range wireless link)
- Relay/Switcher (Provides high-power switching for ignition of additional charges/engines, deploy parachutes, etc)
- Additional Sensors Expansions (Additional Sensors like GPS, etc)
